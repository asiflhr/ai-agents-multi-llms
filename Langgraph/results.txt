Indian cuisine is incredibly diverse, varying substantially across regions due to differences in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations (Wikipedia).  This diversity is reflected in the use of locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits (Wikipedia).  Religious influences, particularly Hinduism and Islam, along with historical events like invasions, trade, and colonialism, have also shaped Indian food (Wikipedia).  The Columbian Exchange introduced staples like potatoes, tomatoes, chilies, peanuts, and guava (Wikipedia).

The cuisine is characterized by a wide range of curries, rice dishes, meats, vegetables, and breads, all flavored with a traditional array of spices (Tavily).  Common spices include cumin, coriander, and turmeric, creating complex and vibrant flavors (Tavily).  While regional variations exist, many similarities in spices and flavors remain across geographical areas (Tavily).  Northern India features rich curries and breads, while Southern India emphasizes rice, lentil-based dishes, and coconut milk-based flavors with herbs like lemongrass and curry leaves (Tavily).  Staple ingredients include rice, tomatoes, potatoes, lentils, chickpeas, onions, and yogurt (Tavily).  Common spices include turmeric, cumin, coriander, mustard seeds, cardamom, chili, garlic, cloves, saffron, fennel, nutmeg, star anise, and fenugreek (Tavily).  The cuisine also offers many vegan options (Tavily).

Indian cuisine's historical impact is significant; the spice trade with Europe fueled the Age of Discovery (Wikipedia).  It has also influenced cuisines worldwide, including those in Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern and East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean (Wikipedia).  Recently, the WWF's Living Planet Report highlighted India's food consumption pattern as the most sustainable among G20 nations (Wikipedia).  Tavily highlights dishes like butter chicken, chole bhature, and various regional specialties, showcasing the breadth and depth of the cuisine.
